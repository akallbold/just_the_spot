# just_the_spot

Just the spot was created to find new places to go to in New York City. It uses information from Grubstreet to identify the best chicken sandwich, bloody mary, donut, coffeeshop to get work done, *you name it* in the city. The best part, is you can see the best of lists on a map and save them to your personal map so you can find places by location as well as by type.

This app uses the following technologies:

FRONTEND
- used React for visual framework
- used Redux for state management
- used Google Maps JavaScript API and Google Maps Geocoding API
- used thunk to implement asynchronous actions with redux

BACKEND
- used b-crypt to encrypt user passwords and JWT for token management
- used Nokogiri to scrape Grubstreet
- used Ruby on Rails, Active-Record, and PostgreSQL to manage database
